This Jason application exemplifies how to develop agent in an organised
society based on the Moise+ organisational model (http://moise.sf.net).

Two platforms are provided:

- S-Moise: a special agent, called OrgManager, is used 
  to manage the organisation

- ORA4MAS: distributed artefacts are used in place of
  OrgManager

See doc folder and examples for more information
