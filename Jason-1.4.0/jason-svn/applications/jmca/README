JMCA: "Jason Module Composition Architecture"

Certain extensibility mechanisms provided by Jason allow an agent
designer to override the methods that implement the various selection
functions of an agent. Conceivably, selection function implementations
may be provided as libraries for general use. However, it becomes
difficult for an agent designer who wishes to simultaneously make use
of multiple such libraries whose implementations overlap, since they
are forced to com- bine code in an ad-hoc fashion (presuming the
library source code is available in the first place).

JMCA offers a solution to this problem as an extension separate to
Jason. JMCA permits multiple selection function implementations to
interact in a well-defined manner. This is achieved by providing a
framework under which an agent designer can encapsulate the
implementation of a selection function within a selection
strategy. Subsequently, an agent making use of JMCA (i.e. extending
the jmca.asSemantics.JmcaAgent class) is capable of composing a chain
of such selection strategies and specifying a mediation strategy to
mediate between the choices they make, thus defining the overall
behaviour produced by the composition chain and ultimately the choices
made by the agent.

A single (default) mediation strategy is provided by JMCA, namely
OverrulingIntersection.

Please see code / javadocs for more information.

The following software is required to run this application:

Java 1.5 (available at http://java.sun.com)
Jason 1.2 (available at http://jason.sf.net)

See ./applications/ for example selection strategy implementations:

* elbpp: "Explicit Level-Based Plan Prioritisation". Orders options
         into levels according to X in "pl(X)" plan label
         annotation. All plans from the highest level are chosen.

* alpha: Orders options in ascending alphabetical order according to
         functor of the plan label predicate and chooses first two
         from the head of the resulting list

See ./examples/ for example usages of JMCA by a Jason agent

* trivial: Simplistic composition of Alpha and Elbpp Option selection
         strategies with the OverrulingIntersection mediation strategy.

Thank you for your interest in JMCA!
