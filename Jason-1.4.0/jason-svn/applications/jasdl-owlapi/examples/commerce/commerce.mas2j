/* .mas2j configuration of the commerce MAS
 * Notes: 
 *      -   this takes advantage of defaults for many of the settings available
 *          for the configuration of a JASDL agent. Please consult docs/mas2jconfiguration
 *          for full documentation of these.
 *      -   in the interests of simplicitly, all agents make use of the same label mappings for ontologies
 *          and (automatic and manual) alias mappings for ontological entities.
 *          These could be set arbitrarily for each agent (and the .asl code updated accordingly) and JASDL would
 *          still function correctly.
 *      -   Each agent in the society must have associated with it an individual in society.owl (with a matching name) and
 *          a ModelAgent instance in the CommerceModel (where its ID matches agent name).
 *      -   Although ontology URIs reference related local resources on the file system, they could equally reference (reachable) remote or local
 *          resources (e.g. http://www.dur.ac.uk/t.g.klapiscak/onts/commerce.owl). In fact, any valid URI can be used here.
 *      -   Since we make extensive use of inverse object properties, we enable the experimental "contraction" feature to ensure their removals
 *          are properly handled.
